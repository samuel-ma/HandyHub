A blue-collar online marketplace is a digital platform that connects skilled and semi-skilled workers with potential employers.
<br/>

It focuses on jobs that require manual labor and typically includes roles such as construction workers, electricians, plumbers, landscapers, and mechanics. 
<br/>

The platform provides a space for workers to advertise their services, showcase their skills, and bid on jobs that match their expertise.
<br/>

Meanwhile, employers can browse through worker profiles, view their ratings and reviews, and hire them directly through the platform.
<br/>

By creating a virtual marketplace for blue-collar workers, this platform helps streamline the hiring process and provides an efficient and cost-effective way for employers to find the right workers for their job.
